#What involes in Intelligence
    -> Ability to intract with the real world to perceive understand and act.
    -> Solving new problems planning and making decision.
    -> Learning and adptioin our internal models, are always being update.

# What is AI ?
Answer: The Study and design of computing systems that perceives its environment and takes actions like human being.


Goal of  Al
-> Thinking rationally 
    using mathematical and logical principles to derive solutions to problems 

-> Action rationally
    take actions to maximize the likelihood of achiving their goal

# Agent 
    -> perceive from environment, gather information using like sensors.
    -> knowledge representation
        Stored -> { A is a men, 
                All men are mortal, }
        -> resoning [ Here take inputs from stored and make new sentences like => A is mortal.]

    -> Intelligent Agent [Agent also called a Models that can make decision from itself]
        -> Agent and Environment
        Definition of an Agent : 
        Answer: 
            An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment throguh sensors and acting upon that environment.
        Definition of a Environment:
        Answer: 

        -> Rationality
        Answer: 
            Rational agent when make it's work 100 percent perfection with it your guess. 

        -> PEAS [Performance Measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors]
        -> Environment Types
        -> Agent Types
    Something Example to image generate by agent
    it's like agent takes perception from the environment.

# Agent Function
    -> Agent Program
    ->The formula for an agent function is: 
        f:P∗ → A
        Where:
        P∗ is the set of all possible percept sequences.
        A is the set of all possible actions.
        f maps a percept sequence to an action.
    This means the agent function determines the action 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 based on the percept sequence 𝑝 ∈ 𝑃∗

# Agent Program vs Agent Function

Aspect          Agent Function                           
Definition      Abstract mapping from percepts to actions.      
Nature          Theoretical and conceptual. 
Example         f: P∗ → A (maps percepts to actions).      
Dependency	    Independent of programming or implementation.            

Aspect          Agent Function                           
Definition      Concrete implementation of the agent function.      
Nature          Practical and executable (in code).
Example         A Python program processing inputs to decide actions.
Dependency	    Depends on specific hardware or software.
