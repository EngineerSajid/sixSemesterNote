# Impact of IoT : Connected Camera

# IoT Enabler 
    -> Wireless Sensor Networks
    -> Cloud Computing
    -> Big Data Analytics
    -> Communication Protocol
    -> Embedded System 

# IoT Challenges
    -> Scale
    -> Security
    -> Privacy 
    -> Big Data and Data Analytics
    -> Interoperability 

# M2M (Machine to Machine) [one question maybe give from here in the mid term exam ]
    -> Application
    -> Communication Networks
    -> 

# Three Common Types of IoT Example:
    -> Industrail
    -> Home Automation
    -> Health Care 

    
# IoT Theory [IoT WF -> IoT Theory]

(1) Physical Devices and controllers: End Point Devices and sensors that send and receive information.
(2) Connectivity: 
    -> Reliable Delivery of information across the Networks
    -> Switching and Routing 
(3) Edge Computing: 
    -> Evalute and Reformat data for processing at higher levels.
(4) Data Accumulation: Captures data and stores it. like -> MySQL

(5) Data Abstraction: Consolidates data into one place or multiple data stores using virtualization.

(6) Application: Monitor, control and provide reports.

(7) Collabration and Processes: Consumes and Shares the Application information.

# Given question like such as 
Question:
    -> Any one layer explantion.
    -> All layers show
    -> Secnerio base, all layers step by step explantion with proper example
