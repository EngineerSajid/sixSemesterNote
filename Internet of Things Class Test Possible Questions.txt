# What is IoT?
Answer: 
    IoT stands for the internet of things. It connects devices to the internet, allowing them to communicate and perform tasks automatically.

# What are some real-life application of IoT?
Answer:
    Smart Home: Controlling lights, fans, and security system remotely.
    Healthcare: Monitoring patients' health remotely.
    Smart Car: Vehicles communicating for better navigation 
    Industry 4.0 : Automated factories using sensor and IoT.
    

# What are the main challenges of IoT?
Answer: 
    Security: Risk of Hacking
    Privacy: Protecting personal data.
    Scalability: managing a large number of devices
    Interoperability: Ensuring different devices work together. 
    Big Data & Analytics: Processing large amounts of data.

# What are the enablers of IoT?
Answer: 
    (1) Wireless Sensor Networks: Collecting real-time data.
    (2) Cloud Computing: Storing and processing data.
    (3) Big Data Analytics: Analyzing large datasets.
    (4) Communication Protocols: Standards for device communication.
    (5) Embedded System: Small computers inside devices 

# M2M vs IoT Making the Choice 
Answer:
M2M technology may be a better choice if:
-> your application requires point to point communication between machines. 

-> your application has limited set of specific machine communication needs that need to be executed quickly and reliably.

-> your application needs to be operational whether or not a WiFi connection is available. 

-> Rapic scalability is not a primary concern for your network. 

-> your device network needs to be isolated for security reasons.


IoT technology may be a better choice if:
-> your application requires real time syncing of many different devices throughout a networking Cloud.

-> your devices have access to a fast and reliable WiFi connection.

-> Devices on your network need the ability to communicate with multiple other devices simultaneously. 

-> your application requires smooth and easy scalability for large numbers of devices and users 

-> your application requires the ability to make its data and devices compatible with multiple standards.
